# AI-Project
EcoCompass is an AI-driven application that helps individuals track and reduce their personal carbon footprint by integrating data from daily travel, purchases, home energy use, and diet.
AI Project: EcoCompass – Smart Personal Carbon Footprint Tracker
Idea in a Nutshell
EcoCompass is an AI-powered mobile and web application that helps individuals track, analyze, and reduce their personal carbon footprint in real time by integrating data from daily activities, purchases, travel, and home energy use, offering personalized sustainability recommendations.

Background
Problem
Climate change is accelerated by high carbon emissions, yet most people lack visibility into their personal environmental impact. Existing footprint calculators are often manual, infrequent, and lack personalized actionable advice.

How common: Daily decisions by billions of individuals collectively drive ~40% of global carbon emissions (IPCC).

Personal motivation: As someone concerned about climate change, I find existing tools fragmented and non-engaging. An intuitive, AI-driven solution could empower more people to adopt sustainable habits.

Importance: Promoting individual accountability with data-driven insights can complement policy and industrial efforts toward net-zero goals.

Data and AI Techniques
Data Sources
User Inputs (manual or via APIs):

Travel: GPS/mobility data (Google Maps API, Apple Mobility).

Purchases: Bank transaction categorization (Plaid API) for estimating product carbon footprints.

Home Energy: Smart meter data or manual utility bill entries.

Diet: Meal logging via text or photo inputs.

Carbon Databases:

UK Govt. GHG Conversion Factors, EPA Emission Factors, OpenFoodFacts (for food items).

External Data:

Local grid carbon intensity (Electricity Maps API).

Public transport schedules and emission factors.

AI Techniques
NLP – For extracting activity details from manual journal entries or receipt scans (using BERT-based models).

Computer Vision – Classifying food or products from photos to estimate emissions (ResNet/CLIP).

Time Series Forecasting – Predicting future footprint based on historical data (LSTM/Transformer models).

Recommendation System – Suggesting low-carbon alternatives using collaborative + content-based filtering.

Anomaly Detection – Identifying unusual high-emission activities (Isolation Forest/Autoencoders).

Demo Implementation (Conceptual)
A simplified Python demo using mock data to predict weekly footprint from travel and diet:

python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Mock data: columns = [km_driven, meat_meals_per_week, public_transport_km, footprint_kg_co2]
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'km_driven': [50, 120, 10, 80, 5],
    'meat_meals': [7, 10, 2, 5, 0],
    'public_transport_km': [20, 5, 100, 30, 150],
    'footprint': [90, 220, 40, 130, 25]
})

X = data[['km_driven', 'meat_meals', 'public_transport_km']]
y = data['footprint']

model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict for a new user
new_user = [[30, 3, 50]]
pred = model.predict(new_user)
print(f"Estimated weekly carbon footprint: {pred[0]:.1f} kg CO2e")
How Is It Used
Context & Users
Primary users: Environmentally conscious individuals, households, sustainability educators.

Usage: Daily tracking via mobile app, weekly reports, goal-setting features.

Affected parties:

Users: Gain awareness and reduce costs (e.g., energy savings).

Communities: Benefit from aggregated anonymized data for local climate initiatives.

Businesses: Access anonymized insights to design greener products/services.

User Journey
Sign up → connect data sources (bank, smart home, mobility).

Dashboard shows real-time footprint breakdown.

AI suggests actions: “Try taking the bus next Thursday, save 2kg CO₂.”

Earn points/ranks for sustainable choices.

Join community challenges.

Challenges
Data Privacy: Sensitive financial and location data requires robust encryption and explicit consent.

Accuracy: Estimates rely on generalized emission factors; individual variations exist.

Behavior Change: App engagement may drop if recommendations feel burdensome.

Digital Divide: Excludes those without smartphones or bank APIs.

Scope Limitations: Focuses on individual actions; doesn’t address systemic/industrial emissions.

What Next
Partnerships with retailers for carbon-labeled products.

Gamification with corporate sustainability programs (employee challenges).

Policy Tool: Aggregate anonymized data to inform urban planning and transit policies.

Advanced Features: Carbon offset marketplace integration, real-time grid-aware appliance usage tips.

Acknowledgments
Data Sources: UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) GHG conversion factors; OpenFoodFacts database.

Inspirations: Existing apps like Joro and Olive; research from MIT’s Climate Portal.

Open Source Libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers, Pandas.

APIs: Plaid, Google Maps, Electricity Maps.

EcoCompass aims to bridge the gap between climate awareness and daily action, empowering individuals with AI to make sustainability simple, measurable, and rewarding.

"## Summary"
EcoCompass is an AI-driven application that helps individuals track and reduce their personal carbon footprint by integrating data from daily travel, purchases, home energy use, and diet. Using machine learning—including NLP for activity logging, computer vision for food recognition, and time-series forecasting for footprint predictions—the app provides personalized, actionable recommendations to encourage sustainable habits. It addresses the need for real-time, user-friendly carbon accountability while acknowledging limitations in data accuracy and privacy. Future expansions include gamification, corporate partnerships, and policy-informing data analytics. The project draws on open-source libraries and public emission databases to make climate action accessible and engaging.
